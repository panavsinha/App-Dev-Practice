List of features:
1. Login Page for existing users (Checks for password length and username included)
2. Register Page for new users (Checks for password length and username included)
3. Drawer - To see the name, e-mail ID of the logged in user, settings, etc.
4. Add to Cart option
5. Checkout option from the cart

This project uses frameworks like VelocityX. Dark mode is also supported by the application.

I enjoyed making this a lot, primarily because I was learning something new.
I hope I can create more apps, with real-world use, using Flutter.

Thank you :)
